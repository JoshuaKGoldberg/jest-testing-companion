# jest-testing-companion

Setting this repository up locally:

```shell
npm i
npm test
npm test -- --watchAll
```

> There'll be a lot of unit test failures reported.
> That's intentional, to show you how those errors look!

If you'd like to be able to use the global `jest` command to run tests:

```shell
npm i -g jest
jest --watchAll
```
